# 🌿 MangroveLEAF

**MangroveLEAF** is an innovative solution that integrates satellite technology with advanced modeling techniques to predict mangrove loss. Built on a robust predictive framework, it leverages extensive datasets like the **Global Mangrove Watch (GMW)** and key satellite-derived indices, including vegetation, built-up, and moisture indices.

MangroveLEAF delivers data-driven insights to guide conservation efforts, complemented by three analytical tools—**STEM**, **BRANCH**, and **STALK**—that deepen understanding and address the underlying drivers of mangrove loss.
